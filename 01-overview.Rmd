>  **CR1b:** Students develop and apply discrete skills identified in the learning objectives within the Big Idea 2: Understand and Analyze. 

>  **CR1c:** Students develop and apply discrete skills identified in the learning objectives within the Big Idea 3: Evaluate Multiple Perspectives.

>  **CR1d:** Students develop and apply discrete skills identified in the learning objectives within the Big Idea 4: Synthesize Ideas.

>  **CR1e:** Students develop and apply collaboration skills identified in the learning objectives within the Big Idea 5: Team, Transform, and Transmit.

>  **CR2b:** Students develop an understanding of the AP Capstone Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information.

>  **CR3:** In the classroom and independently (while possibly consulting any expert advisors), students learn and employ research and inquiry methods to develop, manage, and conduct an in-depth investigation of an area of personal interest, culminating in an academic paper of 4,000-5,000 words that includes the following elements:
>
>  * Introduction
>  * Method, Process, or Approach
>  * Results, Product, or Findings
>  * Discussion, Analysis, and/or Evaluation
>  * Conclusion and Future Directions
>  * Bibliography
  
>  **CR4a:** Students document their inquiry processes, communicate with their teachers and any expert advisors, and reflect on their thought processes.

>  **CR4b:** Students have regular work-in-progress interviews with their teachers to review their progress and to receive feedback on their scholarly work as evidenced by the PREP.

>  **CR5:** Students develop and deliver a presentation (using an appropriate medium) and an oral defense to a panel on their research processes, method, and findings.

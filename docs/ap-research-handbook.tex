These notes are based on Professor Masten's \href{https://modu.ssri.duke.edu/topic/introduction-causal-inference}{online course} on Causal Inference at the Social Science Research Institute at Duke.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Causal effect is often easy to detect with simple actions for which the effect immediately follows (e.g., you caused the alarm clock to stop ringing by pressing the snooze button)
\item
  With multiple causes and delayed effects, causality is much harder to detect.
\item
  Measurement:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Unit of analysis: countries, city blocks, people, firms, etc.
  \item
    Outcome variable: the characteristic of the unit of analysis that we want to affect
  \item
    Policy/treatment variable: the characteristic that we use to change the outcome varialbe
  \end{itemize}
\item
  A lot of characteristics cannot readily be quantified, so we often use proxy variables. For example, GDP could be a proxy for economic development.
\item
  Causality: how an intervention in the policy variable affects the outcome variable
\item
  Data:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The value of the policy variable has to vary in the dataset. Without this variation, you can't analyze how changes in the policy variable might affect the outcome variable.
  \item
    Larger standard deviation = larger variation
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Correlation vs.~Causation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the policy and outcome variables are correlated, this does not necessarily imply a casual relationship.
  \item
    Selection Problem: when units get to choose their policy variable, correlations between policy and outcome variables are unlikely to be causal.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Example: Neighborhoods with a lot of trees tend to have less crime.
    \item
      If this were a casual relationship, then we could plant more trees in a neighborhood and expect crime to go down. However, this is unlikely. More likely, people who tend to commit less crimes chose to live in neighborhoods with tree-lined streets.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Average Treatment Effect

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Causal effects vary among people, so there is a distribution of causal effects in the population.
  \item
    Theoretical ideal: you would know the unit level of causal effect for each person and thus make individualized treatment decisions. This is impossible in practice. You can't know the effect of receiving and not receiving treatment for an individual.
  \item
    Unit-level causal effect: difference in outcome between treatment \& control, holding all other variables fixed
  \item
    Avg. treatment effect (ATE): avg. of all values for unit-level causal effects in a population
  \item
    Avg. outcome under the policy: avg. outcome when everyone is affected by the policy (i.e., receives treatment)
  \item
    Avg. outcome without the policy: avg. outcome when everyone is not affected by policy (i.e., does not receive treatment)
  \item
    ATE = Avg. outcome under policy - Avg. outcome w/o policy
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{experiments}{%
\subsection{Experiments}\label{experiments}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Controlled Experiments

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Control group does not receive treatment
  \item
    Experimental group receives treatment
  \item
    All possible factors that could affect the outcome are identical for both groups, except for the treatment
  \item
    Difference in the outcome between the two groups is the treatment effect
  \item
    Typically used in hard sciences, but difficult to achieve in social sciences given the myriad of factors, many of which are difficult to measure and control
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Randomized Experiments

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Split units randomly into two large groups: treatment or control
  \item
    Right after randomization and before the experiment, both groups should be similar (i.e., avg. values of factors should be about the same), because the split was done randomly and the groups are very large
  \item
    Since the two groups are similar in all factors except treatment, changes in the \emph{average} outcomes are due to treatment
  \item
    Complications:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Noncompliance: Even when you randomly assign treatment, people in the treatment group may not all decide to take the treatment. Also, some people in the control group, who should not receive the treatment, might decide to get the treatment.

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        Solution 1: Intent to Treat Analysis

        \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item
          The \emph{intent} to provide treatment is by design random regardless of treatment non-compliance.
        \item
          Thus, we can examine the causal effect of the option of providing treatment.
        \item
          Downside: cannot analyze causal effect of treatment itself
        \item
          For example, in the Oregon Health Experiment, while a lottery randomly selected people to receive free Medicaid, there was noncompliance in both the treatment/control groups. Original interpretation (effect of Medicaid on health outcomes) can be revised to effect of Medicaid lottery assignment on health outcomes.
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        Solution 2: Instrumental Variables

        \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item
          Advantage: We can analyze the causal effect of the treatment (not just the option of treatment) for a subset of the population.
        \item
          Downside: cannot analyze average treatment effect over the entire population
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        Solution 3: Assume random compliance

        \begin{itemize}
        \tightlist
        \item
          Assume people comply with their treatment assignment.
        \item
          Just drop the entries of the non-compliers.
        \item
          Advantage: We can analyze the causal effect of the treatment over the entire population.
        \item
          Downside: Decision to not comply is probably not random. We don't observe the reasons for non-compliance.
        \end{itemize}
      \item
        Solution 4: Bounds analysis

        \begin{itemize}

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        If nonresponse is not random, you cannot interpret the treatment effect as causal.
      \item
        Example: People in the treatment group with negative outcomes responded to surveys at higher rates than those with positive experiences. Data becomes biased toward negative outcomes for the treatment group.
      \end{itemize}
    \item
      Sample Size: Even with a great research design, small sample size limits statistical inference.

  \item
    Issues:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Ethics: Random assignment of treatment may have difficult ethical considerations (e.g., withholding a potentially life-saving drug to a terminally ill patient assigned to a control group in a randomized trial).
    \item
      Extrapolation: It may be hard to extrapolate the results of a randomized experiment to another study if the treatment conditions and features are different.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Natural Experiments

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item

  \item

  \item

  \tightlist
  \item
    True Natural Experiments

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      treatment was randomly assigned, just not by researcher
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    As-If Natural Experiments

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      treatment not actually randomly assigned, but the treatment/control groups appear randomized as though treatment assignment were random)
    \item
      treatment assignment not related to any variables that could affect outcome
    \item
      balance check: characteristics of all observed variables (other than outcome variable) need to be similar between the treatment/control groups

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        There could still be differences between groups in unobserved variables.
      \item
        Thus, we cannot prove treatment assignment is truly random, but balanced observed variables between groups would be part of a convincingly arugment that the observational data represents an as-if natural experiment.

In AP Calculus, you mostly encountered problems that can be solved analytically. However, in research, many differential equation models do not have analytical forms and must be solved numerically. Matlab is often used in applied math, engineering, and physical sciences for such cases as well as other modeling applications. Octave is an open-source alternative to Matlab. While R not the first language that comes to mind for numerical methods, many \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/NumericalMathematics.html}{numerical R packages} have been developed as well as integration with Matlab, Octave, and Julia.

    First, download MiKTeX. Choose the version corresponding to your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Skip this step if you decide to use ShareLaTeX, which is an online LaTeX editor and does not require your computer to have underlying LaTeX packages via MiKTeX.
  \item
    Recommended, download the basic installer, which will download other uninstalled packages on the fly on an as-needed basis. If you want to download all packages, you can choose the Net Installer, but this may take up a lot of space.

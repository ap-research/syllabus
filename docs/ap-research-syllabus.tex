\end{quote}

\hypertarget{deliverables}{%
\section{Deliverables}\label{deliverables}}

\hypertarget{annotated-bibliography}{%
\subsection{Annotated Bibliography}\label{annotated-bibliography}}

In preparation for the literature review section of your paper, you will create an annotated bibliography of your collected sources. You will describe the key results of each source and show the connection to your research question. As you expand the annotated bibliography, you should consider how you will synthesize the sources into a cohesive literature review for your final paper. Furthermore, your search will allow you to uncover a gap in the literature that you will include in your paper to motivate the relevance and originality of your research question.

\hypertarget{inquiry-proposal-form}{%
\subsection{Inquiry Proposal Form}\label{inquiry-proposal-form}}

Before students begin conducting their research, they must submit an inquiry proposal form to their teacher for approval. Research that involves human subjects will go through an Institutional Review Board (IRB) process to ensure compliance with research ethics. If your research requires IRB review, your inquiry proposal form should include a completed IRB form as well as any accompanying documents such as proposed surveys, interview questions, or questionnaires. Your teacher will not grant approval of your inquiry proposal form until your proposed research has passed IRB review. \textbf{{[}CR2a{]} {[}CR3{]}} \index{CR2a} \index{CR3}

During the approval process of your inquiry proposal form, you are not allowed to begin conducting research. However, in the meanwhile, you should continue your literature review and study general methods applicable to your proposed research as preparation.

\hypertarget{poster-presentation}{%
\subsection{Poster Presentation}\label{poster-presentation}}

Your initial practice and formulation of your final presentation will be an informal poster presentation in which you will present a short elevator speech of your research topic with a poster that contains a problem statement, research question, hypotheses, proposed methods, and references. \textbf{{[}CR1g{]} {[}CR5{]}} \index{CR1g} \index{CR5}

\hypertarget{research-blueprint-poster}{%
\subsection{Research Blueprint Poster}\label{research-blueprint-poster}}

After you have learned more about the research design and methods appropriate for your research, you will design an informal research blueprint poster that outlines your proposed methods. This poster will help you design the methods section of your final presentation slides and provide an opportunity for peer review before you delineate your research methods in more detail in the research proposal. \textbf{{[}CR1g{]} {[}CR5{]}} \index{CR1g} \index{CR5}

\hypertarget{research-proposal}{%
\subsection{Research Proposal}\label{research-proposal}}

After your teacher approves your inquiry proposal form, you may proceed with your research and develop a lengthier research proposal to fine tune and expand upon elements of the inquiry proposal form. The research proposal will contain an introduction with a focused research question and hypothesis, initial draft of a literature review, and details of proposed methods. Many elements of the research proposal will be similar to your responses in the inquiry proposal form, but some sections such as the literature review should include more synthesis and reflect your teacher's feedback on the inquiry proposal form. This research proposal can serve as a template for the first draft of your academic paper. \textbf{{[}CR3{]}} \index{CR3}

\hypertarget{process-and-reflection-portfolio-prep}{%
\subsection{Process and Reflection Portfolio (PREP)}\label{process-and-reflection-portfolio-prep}}

In order to keep track of the research process, students will keep a digital Process and Reflection Portfolio (PREP). The final PREP version should document each step of the research process and include the following items: \textbf{{[}CR4a{]}} \index{CR4a}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Readme file
\item
  Research question (formulation process)
\item
  Annotated bibliography
\item
  IRB and consent forms
\item
  Documentation of interactions with expert advisors
\item
  Inquiry proposal form
\item
  Research proposal
\item
  Paper drafts
\item
  Data with documentation
\item
  Peer review (comments/reflection)
\item
  Poster presentation
\item
  Presentation slides
\item
  Oral defense preparation questions
\item
  Reflection on research process
\item
  Student signature of attestation: ``I affirm that all work contained in this Process and Reflection Portfolio (PREP) is my own and complies with the AP Capstone Policy on Plagiarism and Falsification or Fabrication of Information.''
\end{itemize}

In your weekly check-ins with your teacher, you will use your PREP to demonstrate your research progress. \textbf{{[}CR4b{]}} \index{CR4b}

\hypertarget{academic-paper}{%
\subsection{Academic Paper}\label{academic-paper}}

Your final academic paper should contain 4000--5000 words and include the following components: \textbf{{[}CR3{]}} \index{CR3}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Introduction

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You should contextualize your focused research question in the field of inquiry by synthesizing a literature review that describes the current understanding of your research topic.
  \item
    After the literature review, you should identify a gap in the literature that demonstrates the value of your research question.
  \item
    Your research question should also include your hypothesis or set of hypotheses that you will test using a research method.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Method, Process, or Approach

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    You should select and justify your choice of a qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods approach to test your research question.
  \item
    Ensure that your method is replicable by describing each step of the process in detail with references to additional materials in the appendix if necessary.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Results, Products, or Findings

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Describe both the evidence and results in detail.
  \item
    Explain how you used the evidence in your research method to obtain your results.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Discussion, Analysis, and/or Evaluation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Describe the implications of your findings. If your research did not yield expected results, explain why you believe the outcome did not match your hypothesis.
  \item
    Connect your findings to your research question and the broader field of inquiry.
  \item
    Address limitations of your study.
  \item
    Discuss directions for further studies.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{presentation-and-oral-defense}{%
\subsection{Presentation and Oral Defense}\label{presentation-and-oral-defense}}

You will have 20 minutes to present your research and answer questions from a three-member panel. Your AP Research teacher will be part of the panel and select two additional panel members. While the other panel members will provide notes and input regarding your presentation, only your AP Research teacher will conduct the actual scoring, which will constitute 25\% of your official AP Research score.

After your presentation, each member of the panel will ask one question from the list of oral defense questions found on pages 58--59 of the \href{https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-research-course-and-exam-description.pdf}{AP Research Course and Exam Description}. You will receive one question from each section of the list. Since the oral defense component counts toward the 20-minute limit, you should consider completing your presentation in 16 minutes to allow for enough time for oral defense questions. \textbf{{[}CR5{]}} \index{CR5}

\hypertarget{grades}{%

\item
  Review Chapter 3 of Gray et al.~(2007, pp.~33--56) for an overview on research design.
\item
  Go to the \href{https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/researchdesigns}{USC Libraries Research Guides}. Under ``Types of Research Design'' tab, skim through the various research designs to identify the one that most closely matches your proposed research design as well as those found in your annotated bibliography.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Learn more about your research design and the specific research methods you will employ to conduct your research.
  \item
    As a starting point, establish if you will use qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods. Reference ``6. The Methodology'' tab in \href{https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/researchdesigns}{USC Libraries Research Guides} before you embark on more specific methods.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Review Chapters 8, 9, and 10 in Creswell (2009, pp.~145--225) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods, respectively.
\item
  Create a research blueprint poster and present your proposed research design/methods to the class for peer review. \textbf{{[}CR1e{]} {[}CR1g{]}} \index{CR1e} \index{CR1g}

    Include a readme file that documents the contents and purpose of each folder and file in your PREP. Anyone who reads through your readme file should be able to understand how to navigate your PREP without ever having worked with you during the research process.
  \item
    Finalize data documentation that includes metadata (i.e., data about the data) and step-by-step instructions that show how you used the data in your research methods to arrive at your results. Anyone with your PREP should be able to locate the data documentation file from your readme file descriptions and follow your instructions to replicate your results.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Explore current best practices of reproducible research.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    We will learn basics of literate and data programming with the following software:

    \tightlist
    \item
      R (using RStudio)
    \item
      LaTeX (using TeXStudio)
    \item
      R Sweave (Rnw files = R + LaTeX)
    \item
      R Markdown (R + Markdown to produce HTML, Word, LaTeX, and PDF outputs)
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    We will explore the basic concepts behind version control using Git and GitHub.

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Instead of saving multiple versions of the same file with version numbers appended to the file name, you can use just one file and commit changes to a repository, which will store metadata about each version of the file.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Develop a basic static website to showcase your research for college applications and future employment.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist

    Your research website may include the following elements:

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      About section
    \item
      Research portfolio
    \item
      Research blog posts
    \item
      Publication section
    \end{itemize}
